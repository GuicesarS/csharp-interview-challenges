# C# Interview Challenges

This repository contains technical challenges solved in C#, aimed at improving my backend development skills and preparing for real-world job interviews. The focus is on logic, data structures, API consumption, and practical problem-solving.

Each challenge is stored in its own folder, built with .NET Console projects, and includes a short description and the source code.  
I will keep this repository updated until I get my first opportunity working professionally as a backend developer.

## üß© Topics Covered

- REST API consumption using `HttpClient`
- JSON parsing with `JObject` and `JToken`
- String and array manipulation
- Data counting and filtering using `Dictionary`, `HashSet`, `List`, and LINQ
- Problem-solving with .NET Console apps

## üìÅ Project Structure

Each folder contains an isolated `.NET Console` application for a specific challenge.  
All exercises are organized to be self-contained and easily testable.
